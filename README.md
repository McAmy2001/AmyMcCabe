# Challenge, week 2: Personal Profile Page

## The purpose of this project is to build an initial profile webpage with information about me and my work that potential employers can look at to determine fitness for open positions. This profile will be updated throughout the bootcamp with the new work I do. 

### I built my profile page using the HTML and CSS information covered in the first two modules of bootcamp. I also used online resources when I wanted to do something that I didn't know how to do, mainly w3Schools.com. 

### After laying out my initial HTML outline, I began the CSS styling by choosing a photo (one that I took on the shores of Lake Superior in northern MN, my home state) for my hero section and then designing a complementary color palette around that photo. 

### From there, I built and styled the header and footer which were fairly strightforward. 

### The main section with the 'About Me' and 'Work' sections followed and were the spots that required the most "fiddling". I chose a flex box with two children to begin, the 'Work' flexbox then having a nested flexbox for the individual work projects. I was having trouble getting that to layout to work the way I hoped so I then tried a CSS Grid. That seemed the answer to my troubles until I moved on to the next task of making the page respond to different screen sizes. The Grid idea fell apart at this point and I went back to flexbox plan, which, with some tinkering, finally came out the way I wanted.

### My profile page was built using [Git Hub Pages](https://mcamy2001.github.io/AmyMcCabe/).

#### For this initial profile page a Table of Contents, Installation Instructions, Usage Information, Credits, License Information, Badges, Features, and Tests are not necessary but I'd like to acknowledge that those would be included here when pertinent.
